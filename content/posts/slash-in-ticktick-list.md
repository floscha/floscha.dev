title: "Using the Slash Symbol in TickTick List Names"

When trying to use the `/` symbol (Unicode `U+002F`) in the name of a [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/) list, you'll encounter an error indicating that this character isn't allowed.
However, there's an easy workaround: you can use the `Ôºè` symbol (Unicode `U+FF0F`) instead, which looks nearly identical but is permitted in TickTick.
