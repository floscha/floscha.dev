## Motivation: The Value of Short, Effective Workouts

Finding time for regular exercise can be tough, especially when life gets busy. Tabata—a form of high-intensity interval training (HIIT)—makes it possible to squeeze effective, energizing workouts into even the most hectic schedules. In fact, multiple studies show that HIIT sessions as short as six minutes can deliver not only impressive physical results but also cognitive benefits.

With these advantages in mind, I felt strongly that a high-quality Tabata app should be available to everyone, free of charge and without barriers.

## Solution: Building a Truly Free App

That's why I created a Tabata app that's completely free for anyone to use at [free-tabata.com](https://free-tabata.com) and works on both desktop and mobile devices. The app is also [open source](https://github.com/floscha/free-tabata), so anyone is welcome to contribute, suggest improvements, or even fork the project to build their own version.

I designed the app to be minimalistic and lightweight, built as a static website and hosted on GitHub Pages. This means there's no backend to maintain and no ongoing costs for me (apart from the domain). As a result, I can keep the app sustainable and accessible without needing to monetize it.

If you're searching for a simple, effective, and truly free Tabata timer, I invite you to give it a try. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome!
